           <p>St. Lucia The St.Lucia is nestled on the mouth of the grand St.Lucia Estuary and is located on the southern most point of St.Lucia Wetlands Park. The town on the whole has not many things to offer the traveler, but is an ideal base to explore a number of adventure activities around the area. Whale-watching, biking, hiking, kayaking and wildlife safari tours are all enough to make your stay in the town of St.Lucia more than worthwhile</p>
